## Additional Notes

- We were trying to target the following problem: Misinformation and disinformation through livestreams is incredibly rampant.
- We think this idea is just a **proof-of-concept**. The integration may not be the best, but we believe there is definitely a future in which this service is commonly used and extremely impactful.
  - Imagine opening up your TV and there is real-time information on the side of news broadcasts, where there is important information being added that could change the trajectory of your life.
  - Itâ€™s very important to keep the general public informed and stop the spread of misinformation/disinformation, and we think that Transparify is the first novel project at envisioning how LLMs can curb this in the future.
